<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a description of the MATLAB code and data accompanying the paper &quot;On Comparing Heterogeneity Across Biomarkers&quot; by Steininger et al, to be<br />published in Cytometry A.</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this work is a method to determine the extent to which (possibly non-co-stained) biomarkers re-identify the same cellular subpopulations.<br />Crucially, this method does not require biomarkers of interest to be co-stained on the same cells. It is enough if the biomarkers are stained (possible separately)<br />on common set of cell lines, where subpopulations are identified independently for each marker.</p>
<p>The degree of subpopulation re-identification between markers is quantified by using the so called Subpopulation Structure Similarity(S3) score.</p>
<p>Correspondingly,the primary novelty of the MATLAB code supplied here is the calculation of the S3 score between a pair of biomarkers taking as input the<br />subpopulation profiles (fractions of cells in different sub-populations) of the biomarkers across a common set of cell lines. This code can be found<br />in the <code>Core_Functions</code> directory. More specifically, if the subpopulation profiles for a set of biomarkers are stored in <code>profiles.mat</code> in a format described<br />in the data section below, then executing:</p>
<pre><code>Calculate_S3_Scores(&#39;profiles.mat&#39;,&#39;S3_output.mat&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>will calculate the S3 scores between all pairs of biomarkers and store the result in <code>S3_output.mat</code> in a format described in the Data section below.</p>
<p>The following code is additionally provided to reproduce the figures given in the main text. All code below was tested using Matlab v.2014a.</p>
<h2 id="figures">Figures:</h2>
<p>The .m files in the root level directory are scripts that will generate the figures in the paper. It should be noted that while there should be strong qualitative<br />agreement between the figures generated using this code and those published in the paper, there may be minor quantitative difference. These differences are on account<br />of the randomness inherent to the process of generating subpopulation profiles (most results shown are found by averaging results across multiple runs).</p>

<h3 id="figure-2-simple-demonstration-using-2-subpopulations">Figure 2: Simple demonstration using 2 subpopulations</h3>
<p>2 pairs of <strong>non-co-stained</strong> biomarkers were stained on a common set of cell lines. For each biomarker cells were classified into low and high expressing subpopulations.<br />In the plots, each point corresponds to a single cell line and it's x and y coordinates are given by the fraction of cells in low (or high as specified) subpopulations. The<br />relations between the subpopulation fractions tell us about the relationship between the subpopulations of the different markers. To generate this figure execute</p>

<h3 id="figure-3-validation">Figure 3: Validation</h3>
<p>The extent to which subpopulation state based on one biomarker predict those of another is determined by co-staining the biomarkers, and quantified using<br />the mutual information between the biomarkers' subpopulation assignments. The S3 score, which does not require co-staining, is then compared to this<br />gold standard of mutual information for multiple biomarker pairs. The figure consists of two parts</p>

<h2 id="data">Data:</h2>
<p>The data used in this experiment comes from two different sets of experiments</p>
<ol>
<li>LCC: a panel of 33 lung cancer cell lines stained for various biomarkers. This is referred to as <strong><code>cancer_cell_lines</code></strong> in the data.</li>
<li>CP: A panel of 49 clones of a single lung cancer cell line (H460) stained for various biomarkers. This is referred to as <strong><code>clone</code></strong> in the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data to generate various figures is present in the <code>Data</code> directory. There are three different kinds of data stored</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: Raw features for each cell in the data set across all biomarkers:<code>features.mat</code></li>
<li><strong>Profiles</strong>: Subpopulation profiles for the different cell lines in the data set:<code>profiles.mat</code> (with biomarker specific number of subpopulations)<br />and <code>2subpop_profiles.mat</code> (for profiles with only 2 subpopulations for all marker as need for Figure 2)</li>
<li><strong>S3</strong>: S3 scores between the different pairs of biomarkers:<code>S3.mat</code> and <code>S3_paper.mat</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: <code>S3.mat</code> was generated using the profiles and code provided here. <code>S3_paper.mat</code> contains the results shown in the paper,<br />and calculated on a computing cluster using a larger number of randomizations and synthetic repeats. The mean levels are similar for both files,<br />but <code>S3_paper.mat</code> shows a smaller error bars on account of increased sampling.</p>
<p>Each file contains the corresponding data for both data sets. The descriptions of the different data formats are below.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>To load the features use:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; feature_data=load(&#39;features.mat&#39;)

feature_data = 

       data_set_names: {&#39;clone&#39;  &#39;cancer_cell_lines&#39;}
    data_set_features: {2x1 cell}</code></pre>
<p>The features themselves are stored within the variable <code>data_set_features</code>, each element of which contains the features for a single data set. The variable <code>data_set_names</code> tells<br />us that the first element of <code>data_set_features</code> contains the data for the <code>clone</code> data set, while the second element contains the data for the <code>cancer_cell_lines</code>.</p>
<p>Thus to view the data for the <code>cancer_cell_lines</code> data one would use:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; feature_data.data_set_features{2}

ans = 

          marker_names: {11x1 cell}
    marker_set_numbers: [11x1 double]
         feature_names: {11x1 cell}
          feature_data: {11x1 cell}</code></pre>
<p>The variables are organized on a per biomarker basis (11 biomarkers were studied in this data set). They are described in greater detail below:</p>
<h4 id="marker_names">1. <code>marker_names</code></h4>
<p>is a cell array containing the names of the various biomarkers</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; feature_data.data_set_features{2}.marker_names

ans = 

    &#39;DNA&#39;
    &#39;betacatenin&#39;

    &#39;pPTEN&#39;
    &#39;DNA&#39;
    &#39;H3K9Ac&#39;
    &#39;pAkt&#39;
    &#39;DNA&#39;
    &#39;E-Cadherin&#39;</code></pre>
<h4 id="feature_names">2. <code>feature_names</code>:</h4>
<p>The single cell features used are marker specific, and this information is contained in the cell array <code>feature_names</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; feature_data.data_set_features{2}.feature_names     

ans = 

    &#39;Average DNA Nuclear Intensity&#39;
    &#39;Average Cytoplasmic Intensity&#39;

    &#39;Average DNA Nuclear Intensity&#39;

    &#39;Average Cellular Intensity&#39;
    &#39;Average DNA Nuclear Intensity&#39;
    &#39;Average Cytoplasmic Intensity&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Thus, for the second biomarker (betacatenin), each cell is characterized by the average intensity of that biomarker in the cytoplasmic pixels of that cell.</p>
<h4 id="marker_set_numbers">3. <code>marker_set_numbers</code>:</h4>
<p>Since it is only possible co-stain a few markers on a cell, the biomarkers were split into different marker-sets. All biomarkers within the same marker-set were co-stained, and thus the levels of these biomarkers is measured simultaneously on the same cells. For biomarkers in different marker-sets, no cell is stained<br />for both biomarkers. <code>marker_set_numbers</code> is an array specifying which marker set each biomarker belongs to.</p>

<p>Thus the first three biomarkers (dna,betacetenin and vimentin were costained), but the second and eleventh biomarkers (betacatenin and e-cadherin) were not.</p>
<h4 id="feature_data">4. <code>feature_data</code>:</h4>
<p>This contains the values of single cell features organized by cell-line</p>

<p>Each element of <code>feature_data</code> corresponds to the collection of single cell features for a single biomarker. Within each element we have a further<br />grouping by cell lines. Since the <code>cancer_cell_lines</code> dataset contains 33 cell lines there are 33 elements. Thus</p>

    data_set_profiles: {2x1 cell}
</code></pre>
<p><code>data_set_names</code> and <code>data_set_profiles</code> are similar to the corresponding elements in features except that <code>data_set_profiles</code> contains subpopulation profiles<br />(rather than feature data).</p>
<p>The profile data for the <code>cancer_cell_lines</code> data set can be accessed as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; profile_data.data_set_profiles{2}

ans =

              profiles: {11x10 cell}
    subpop_assignments: {11x10 cell}</code></pre>
<p>The organization of this data is by biomarker (this dataset contains 11 biomarkers), just as for the feature data. The fields <code>marker_names</code>,<br /><code>marker_set_numbers</code> and <code>feature_names</code> are identical to those used for the feature data. Thus the new fields are</p>
<h4 id="subpop_models">1. <code>subpop_models</code>:</h4>
<p>To assign cells to subpopulations, the single cell features corresponding to each biomarker are fit to a gaussian mixture model. <code>subpop_models</code> contains these models.<br />Since the models are the result of a non-convex optimization process, there is a stochastic element to them. To obtain more robust results, we<br />therefore generate 10 different &quot;synthetic replicate&quot; models for each biomarker (these models should, in principle, be the same, differing only in the stochasticity resulting<br />from the optimization process).</p>

<p>As above, each row correspond to a biomarker and each column to a synthetic replicate. Each element of this cell array is a matrix with rows<br />correponsind to cell lines (there are 33 cell lines in this dataset) and columns to subpopulations. Since that the number of subpopulations is biomarker<br />specific, all replicates for a biomarker use the same number of subpopulations.</p>
<h3 id="s3">S3</h3>
<p>To load the S3 results</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; s3_data=load(&#39;S3.mat&#39;)

s3_data = 

    data_set_names: {2x1 cell}
       data_set_S3: {2x1 cell}

&gt;&gt; s3_data.data_set_names</code></pre>
<p>The top level organization follows the same format as features and profiles. To access the S3 data for the second data set we would use</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; s3_data.data_set_S3{2}

ans = 

        s3_matrix: [11x11 double]
     marker_names: {11x1 cell}
    s3_matrix_std: [11x11 double]</code></pre>
<p>Results are organized by biomarker (there are 11 biomarkers for this dataset), as for profiles and features. <code>marker_names</code> is the same as for features and profiles.</p>
<h4 id="s3_matrix">1. <code>s3_matrix</code>:</h4>
<p>Contains the S3 score between all possible pairs of biomarkers. Thus the S3 score between the 3rd and 4th biomarkers can be found as</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; s3_data.data_set_S3{2}.s3_matrix(3,4)

ans =

    0.0254</code></pre>
<h4 id="s3_matrix_std">2. <code>s3_matrix_std</code>:</h4>
<p>This matrix captures the uncertainty in the S3 measurements arising from the stochasticity in optimizations. This is estimated<br /> based on the standard deviation in the S3 scores across all possible pairs of synthetic replicates for the two biomarkers being considered. The<br /> indexing is the same as for <code>s3_matrix</code></p>
